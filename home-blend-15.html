          This document describes an engineering practice focused on the
          development of AI-driven software tools for bioinformatics research.
          We propose a model of embedded engineering: working alongside research
          teams to build machine learning pipelines, biological data platforms,
          and custom analysis tools. We outline three primary service areas and a
          three-phase engagement methodology designed to maximize knowledge
          transfer and research continuity.

        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <div class="two-col">
          <h3>1.1 AI/ML Pipeline Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            We build and deploy machine learning models for genomic, proteomic,
            and clinical datasets. Our work spans sequence analysis, variant
            calling, protein structure prediction, and predictive modeling —
            always with an emphasis on reproducibility and production readiness.
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 Bioinformatics Platform Development</h3>
          <p>
            End-to-end platforms for managing, processing, and analyzing
            biological data at research scale. We focus on architecture that
            supports the volume and complexity of modern omics data while
            remaining operable by research teams.
          </p>

          <h3>1.3 Research Software Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Custom applications, visualizations, and interfaces designed for
            researchers. We participate in the full lifecycle — from
            understanding the biological question to deploying tools that help
            answer it.

        <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Our engagement model follows three phases, each designed to minimize
          disruption to ongoing research while maximizing knowledge transfer.
        </p>

        <div class="methodology-block">
          <h3>2.1 Domain Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            We begin by understanding the research domain — the biological
            questions, the data types, and the existing computational
            infrastructure. The goal is an honest assessment of where software
            is limiting discovery.

            We work across genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and clinical

          <h3>2.2 Embedded Development</h3>
          <p>
            We work as embedded engineers alongside your bioinformaticians and
            researchers, writing production code, training and deploying ML
            models, and building the platforms your research requires.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="methodology-block">
          <h3>2.3 Transfer</h3>
          <p>
            Formal handoff including documentation of architectural decisions,
            training on deployed systems, and a post-engagement review to ensure
            your team can operate and extend everything independently.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="figure-label">
          <em>Table 1.</em> Engagement phases proceed sequentially; duration
          varies by research scope.
